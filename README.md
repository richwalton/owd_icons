These are recreated Icons to be used twith Open Weather Map site.

I created these because when I was creating a weather app I found that many of the exsiting OWM icons where not very good (clashed with background).
For Example the clear sky image was orange for daytime and black for nighttime. Both looked really bad on my blue background. So I re-did them in white. 

This made for bad UX, so I redesigned them in SVG format(they were just PNG) because it made for quicker loading, less space and easily re-sizable.
Also I added redesigned PNG's for options.
