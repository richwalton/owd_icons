These are recreated Icons to be used twith Open Weather Map site.

I created these because when I was creating an weather app I found that many of the exsiting OWM icon where not very good (clashed with background).
For Example the clear sky image was orange for day time and black for nighttime. Both looked really bad on my blur background. So I redid them in white 

This made for bad UX, so i redesigned them in SVG format(they were PNG) because it made for quicker loading, less space and easily resizable.
